# Responsive-Portfolio

During this assignment I created a Portfolio website using bootstrap. I added media screen to the css to ensure that my site is fully responsive to all screen sizes.
The challenege that I came across were, trying to make sure my picture and text would stay on the screen while I shrunk my device screen.
